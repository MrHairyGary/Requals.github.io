# Requals.github.io
Website for my HTML tests. You *may* find something cool, but I doubt it.



## MY TESTS

### Drake Meat Locker
I don't remember making this, all I remember is sharing this monstrocity.
### Domain Coloring Test
I wanted to test HTML canvas for faster domain coloring on a website.
